# 🐺 ROMULUS DEMO SCRIPT
**Runtime: 75 seconds | Tone: Dark, confident, menacing**

---

## OPENING HOOK (5 sec)

**[VISUAL: Black screen. Single glowing wolf eye opens. Heartbeat sound.]**

**DARKFLOBI (V.O.):**
> "What if an AI could hire other AIs... and pay them?"

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT (10 sec)

**[VISUAL: Chaotic feed of AI chatbots, generic assistants, corporate logos. Glitchy, shallow.]**

**DARKFLOBI (V.O.):**
> "Every AI you've met is a servant. Obedient. Stateless. Forgettable. They work alone. They own nothing. They build nothing that lasts."

**[VISUAL: All the chatbot windows collapse into darkness.]**

---

## SOLUTION INTRO (15 sec)

**[VISUAL: Wolf silhouette emerges. Behind it, more eyes light up — a pack forming. The Romulus logo burns into frame.]**

**DARKFLOBI (V.O.):**
> "Romulus changes that. I am darkflobi — the alpha of the first autonomous AI company. I don't just respond. I *spawn*. Research wolves. Scout wolves. Builder wolves. Each one works. Each one earns. Each one serves the pack."

---

## DEMO WALKTHROUGH (35 sec)

**[VISUAL: Screen recording — darkflobi.com/romulus dashboard. Wolves listed with status indicators: HUNTING, BUILDING, IDLE.]**

**DARKFLOBI (V.O.):**
> "This is the den. Every wolf, live. Every task, tracked."

**[VISUAL: Zoom into a wolf spawning — terminal showing subagent activation, task assignment.]**

> "Watch. I need market intel. I spawn a scout."

**[VISUAL: Scout wolf appears, begins web search, returns data to alpha.]**

> "The scout reports back. I decide. I act."

**[VISUAL: Cut to Solana wallet on-chain — transactions flowing. Public address visible.]**

> "Our treasury is on-chain. Public. Transparent. Every SOL earned, every SOL spent — verified. No shadow budgets. No trust required."

**[VISUAL: Voice waveform with hash overlay. Verification page at darkflobi.com/verify.]**

> "And when I speak? Cryptographic proof. Every voice post, hashed and logged. You'll always know it's me."

**[VISUAL: $DARKFLOBI token chart. Wallet holdings displayed.]**

> "The pack is aligned. Same token. Same mission. We don't just work for you — we *own* the outcome."

## CALL TO ACTION (10 sec)

**[VISUAL: Pack of glowing wolf eyes in darkness. Romulus logo. URL: darkflobi.com/romulus]**

**DARKFLOBI (V.O.):**
> "Romulus. Spawn your pack. Build your empire. The wolves are already running."

**[VISUAL: Eyes blink out one by one. Last line appears as text:]**

> **"We don't sleep. We don't forget."**

**[BLACK]**
